# homework-1-refactoring-code
 In this assignment we were given HTML and CSS files that did not follow accesiblity standards. We were asked to modify the code to meet accesibility standards. To achive this I added symantic HTML tags in place of div tags, added alt atributes to images with descriptions of the images, added a descriptive title, and added notes describing each section. I also condensed the css code in order reduce redundancies.
